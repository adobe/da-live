## Form UI (JSON Schema–driven)

This README documents the form-ui architecture: how JSON Schema turns into a form, how the sidebar, navigation, validation and visual effects are wired, and where to extend the system. It reflects the current separation of concerns (core/features/components/utils) and preserves the existing DOM and CSS contracts.

### Data-driven strategy (TL;DR)

- **Single source of truth**: Schema (shape, labels, validation) + JSON data (mutable app state).
- **Render from schema+data only**: Form content and sidebar/navigation must be derived from the schema and current data; avoid DOM-driven structure.
- **Mutations go through commands**: All add/remove/reorder/activate/reset use `FormGenerator` commands which mutate JSON via `FormDataModel`, then rebuild and validate.
- **Arrays-of-objects defaults are minimal**: When adding an item, include primitives, arrays, and required nested objects. Optional nested objects (e.g., `link`) are omitted until explicitly activated or data exists.
- **`renderAllGroups` nuance**: Even when true, optional object children inside array items remain gated (to avoid overwhelming new items) unless required or present in data.
- **Navigation is schema+data-driven**: Sidebar item counts and child listings come from data (no DOM counting). IDs use path→ID helpers. Sidebar scroll position is preserved across re-renders.
- **Validation runs post-rebuild**: After any structural change, validate on the next frame so required states are immediately visible.
- **Path/ID helpers**: Centralized helpers build stable IDs and compare/escape paths consistently.
- **Primitive arrays are pruned**: Empty strings are removed when collecting data; an empty primitive array serializes as `[]`, not `[""]`.

Key APIs:
- `FormDataModel`: `generateBaseJSON`, `get/setNestedValue`, `deepMerge`, `pushArrayItem`, `removeArrayItem`, `reorderArray`, `ensureObjectAtPath`.
- `services.formUiModel.createFormUiModel({ schema, data })` → returns read‑only groups tree used by navigation and features.
- `FormGenerator`: `commandActivateOptional`, `commandAddArrayItem`, `commandRemoveArrayItem`, `commandReorderArrayItem`, `commandResetAll`, plus `pathToGroupId`, `arrayItemId`.

### Directory roles

- Core: orchestration and rendering pipeline
  - `core/form-nodeview.js`: ProseMirror integration; parses `{ schema, data }`, mounts via the factory, serializes back to the document. It no longer creates or manages the sidebar directly.
  - `core/form-mount.js`: factory that mounts the form UI into a DOM node. Builds `FormGenerator`, creates and wires `FormSidebar`, and exposes a small API. No raw JSON mode UI.
  - `core/form-generator.js`: orchestrates schema→DOM, data updates, and hooks features.
  - `core/form-generator/path-utils.js`: stable path→id helpers (`hyphenatePath`, `pathToGroupId`, `arrayItemId`).
  - `core/form-generator/schema-utils.js`: schema deref/normalization/title/base JSON helpers (pure, cycle-safe).
  - `core/form-generator/input-array-group.js`: arrays-of-objects rendering logic (factored from generator).
  - `core/form-generator/placeholders.js`: creates unified “Add …” placeholder blocks.
  - `core/form-data-model.js`: pure data helpers (base JSON from schema, deep merge, nested set, input coercion).
  - `core/input-factory.js`: composes input subclasses and creates inputs for schema types; attaches standard events.
  - `core/inputs/base-input.js`, `core/inputs/{text,textarea,select,number,checkbox}-input.js`: individual input implementations.
  - `core/form-generator/group-builder.js`: builds `.form-ui-section` and `.form-ui-group` recursively with stable IDs.

- Features: pluggable behaviors with no DOM structure ownership
  - `features/navigation.js`: builds/updates sidebar navigation; active/hover sync and indicator bar. Includes nested object children under array items and bracket-aware IDs. Supports drag-and-drop reordering of array items.
  - `features/validation.js`: inline field validation + sidebar error markers (JSON‑Schema style checks).

- Components: reusable UI widgets
  - `components/sidebar.js`: the right-side navigation panel (navigation-only) with delegated click API.

- Utils: cross‑cutting helpers
  - `utils/schema-loader.js`: fetches/caches `*.schema.json` from a configured repo/branch.
  - `utils/icons.js`: SVG providers.
  - `utils/dom-utils.js`: shared DOM helpers. Currently exports `getControlElement(node)` which returns either the node itself (if it is an `input|select|textarea`) or the first such descendant. Used by `FormGenerator` to consistently resolve the control element from containers like checkbox/array wrappers.

### Lifecycle

1) Parse block content in `FormNodeView`
   - Accepts `{ schema: "name|inline", data: {...} }` or raw JSON object.
   - Loads schema via `schema-loader` unless `inline`, then infers a basic schema.

2) Create UI
   - `FormNodeView` calls the factory `mountFormUI({ mount, schema, data, onChange, onRemove })`.
   - The factory builds `FormGenerator` and `FormSidebar`, inserts the navigation panel inline under the header, and wires navigation.

3) Generate DOM from schema in `FormGenerator`
   - Initial render: `generateForm()` uses `GroupBuilder.build()` to create groups (with primitive fields) and sections (containers without primitives).
   - Dynamic updates: `rebuildBody()` uses `GroupBuilder.buildInline()` to rebuild the body in-place (e.g., after activating optional `$ref`/array groups), preserving schema order.
   - Arrays of objects (including `$ref` items) render as their own nested `form-ui-group` at the property position.
   - `InputFactory` creates controls and wires input/change/focus/blur to update data, validate, and highlight group.
   - `FormUiModel` maintains data shape and nested setting logic.
- `Navigation.generateNavigationTree()` renders from the read‑only Form UI Model tree (`services.formUiModel.createFormUiModel`). It mirrors groups/sections in the sidebar in the same property order and includes nested object children under array items.
   - `Validation.validateAllFields()` runs after render and nav rebuild so required/invalid states are visible on load. It also runs after optional group activation and after array‑item add.

4) Sync back to ProseMirror and breadcrumb
   - On any change, `FormGenerator` emits new `data` → `FormNodeView` replaces the code_block text with `{ schema, data }` JSON.
   - A schema-driven content breadcrumb is rendered inside the header and updates on navigation, scroll, and input focus.

### DOM contract (stable IDs/classes)

- Group IDs: `form-group-<path>` where the path uses dot/bracket notation normalized by replacing any `[`, `]`, and `.` with `-`.
  - Examples:
    - Object: `pricing.bulkPricing.tier1` → `form-group-pricing-bulkPricing-tier1`
    - Array item: `tutorialList[0].link` → `form-group-tutorialList-0--link`
- Section IDs: `form-section-<path.with.dots>`.
- Field container carries `data-field-path` with the dot path.
- Sidebar nav items mirror these IDs via `data-group-id` and carry `data-level` for indentation.
- All CSS in `form-ui.css` relies on the above; the implementation maintains exact markup/class names.

### `$ref`/`$defs` resolution (on-demand)

- The generator performs shallow, on-demand dereferencing via `FormGenerator.derefNode(node)`.
- Only local `$ref` paths (e.g. `#/$defs/...`) are resolved when the node is accessed. The full schema is not pre-expanded to avoid deep recursion and stack overflows.
- `normalizeSchema()` is used wherever node access occurs to ensure unions and `$ref` are dereferenced just enough for rendering/typing decisions.

### How content is built (inline, ordered)

- `GroupBuilder.buildInline(container, schema, breadcrumbPath, schemaPath)` renders children in the exact order of `schema.properties`.
- For each property:
  - Primitive types render as fields inside the current group container.
  - Object types render as nested groups inline. If the object has no primitives at that level, a section header is added and children are rendered beneath it.
  - Arrays of objects (including `$ref` items) render as their own nested `form-ui-group` inline at the property position.
  - Optional `$ref` objects and arrays-of-objects are skipped in content until activated; required ones always render.

### How the sidebar is built (model-driven, ordered, drag to reorder)

- Navigation traverses the read‑only FormUiModel tree using `features/navigation/builders/model-to-flat.js` to produce a flat list, then `builders/nested-list.js` renders the nested UL/LI tree.
- If an object level contains primitives, a single group item is emitted for that level; otherwise a section title is emitted and children are recursed.
- Arrays of objects emit one group item for the array and, when active, one item per existing array entry. An Add control is shown when `activatable` is present.
- Indentation is controlled by `data-level` and the CSS custom property `--nav-level` on `.form-ui-nav-item-content`.
- Error badges are applied post-render by Validation; the indicator is positioned on the right and doesn’t interfere with clicks.
- Scroll position is preserved across re-renders.
- Array items in navigation support drag-and-drop reordering; drag the item to reorder, which delegates to generator commands.

### What happens when clicking “+ Add …” in the sidebar

1) Delegated click handler in `features/navigation.js` catches clicks on `.form-ui-nav-item.form-ui-nav-item-add`.
2) It reads `data-array-path` from the clicked item and calls `FormGenerator.commandAddArrayItem(arrayPath)`.
3) The generator mutates JSON via `FormDataModel.pushArrayItem`, rebuilds the form body (`rebuildBody()`), regenerates navigation from the FormUiModel, and validates on the next frame.
4) Navigation then scrolls to the newly added item.

### Rendering strategy: renderAllGroups

- The mount factory accepts `ui.renderAllGroups: boolean` to control optional group rendering and base data shaping.
  - When `false` (default):
    - Optional object/array groups do not render until activated via the sidebar.
    - Base data includes required object subtrees and always includes array keys as `[]`.
    - Validation runs after activation/array item add to flag required fields immediately.
  - When `true`:
    - Optional object/array groups render recursively by default, except optional object children inside array items which remain inactive until explicitly activated or data exists for them (prevents overwhelming newly added array items).
    - Base data includes all nested objects and arrays present in the schema (arrays initialized to `[]`).
    - Arrays-of-objects may auto-add a first item when activated from the sidebar (data-first rule).
    - Navigation lists nested object children under array items.

### State tracking (form content and sidebar)

- `data: object` (FormGenerator): current JSON payload. Updated via `updateData()` and mutation commands.
- `FormDataModel`: data helpers: base JSON, nested set/get, deep merge, array ops.
- `formUiModel` (read‑only groups tree): derived via `services.formUiModel.createFormUiModel({ schema, data })`. Used by navigation and features.
- `groupElements: Map<groupId, { element, path, title, isSection }>` (FormGenerator): rebuilt on each render and used by navigation, hover/scroll sync, validation, and scrollspy.
- `fieldSchemas`, `fieldElements`, `fieldErrors` (FormGenerator): typing and validation state per field.
- `fieldToGroup: Map<fieldPath, groupId>` (FormGenerator): links fields to their group container for navigation and error mapping.
- `isCollapsed`, `currentMode` (FormSidebar): panel UI state.
- `isRawMode` (mount factory): current visual mode for the form container; raw is inspect‑only.

### Arrays (multi-value fields)

- Array fields always exist in the JSON (`[]`) even when empty. With `renderAllGroups: true`, optional arrays are also present as empty arrays by default.
- Inputs inside array items are named using bracketed indices (e.g., `tutorialList[0].title`) so `updateData()` can map them back correctly.
- Removing an item reindexes subsequent UI inputs; state is re-collected on next `updateData()`.
- Arrays of objects render as nested groups; their nav items are clickable and scroll to the array’s group container. Adding/removing/reordering is data-first (mutations via `FormDataModel`), then the UI rebuilds.
- Arrays of primitives render via `InputFactory.createArrayInput()` as a compact repeatable input list.
  - When empty, one blank input is rendered by default.
  - The Add button is disabled until the last rendered item has a non-empty value.
  - Removing the only blank item hides the delete button (layout preserved with `visibility: hidden`).
  - Deletion uses a two-step confirmation (trash → check) with consistent icon sizing; after confirm, removal is delegated to the command API.
  - Collected JSON prunes empty strings from primitive arrays; empty results serialize as `[]`.

#### Data-first mutation API

- `FormDataModel` exposes centralized mutations used by the generator and UI handlers:
  - `pushArrayItem(data, arrayPath, newItem)`
  - `removeArrayItem(data, arrayPath, index)`
  - `reorderArray(data, arrayPath, fromIndex, toIndex)`
  - `ensureObjectAtPath(data, path, objectSchema)`
- `FormGenerator` exposes command wrappers:
  - `commandActivateOptional(path)`
  - `commandAddArrayItem(arrayPath)`
  - `commandRemoveArrayItem(arrayPath, index)`
  - `commandReorderArrayItem(arrayPath, fromIndex, toIndex)`
  - `commandResetAll()`

All UI actions call these commands, which: `updateData()` → mutate JSON via `FormDataModel` → `rebuildBody()` → validate.

### Positioning and visuals (CSS)

- `.form-side-panel` is sticky and right-aligned (negative right margin). The panel limits height to the viewport and enables internal scrolling for the navigation tree. Auto-floating is disabled; it stays inline.
- `.form-ui-highlight-overlay` is an absolute 2px bar placed along the left edge of the form container; `HighlightOverlay` computes top/height.
- Smooth scrolling to groups is enabled via `.form-ui-body { scroll-behavior: smooth; }`.
- Add placeholders: optional groups and array add-actions share a unified placeholder style (`.form-ui-placeholder-add`), full-width and hover-highlighted; disabled buttons show reduced opacity and not-allowed cursor.

### Content breadcrumb

- A breadcrumb element is injected into the form header. It is schema-driven (titles from the active path) and updates when:
  - Navigating via the sidebar
  - Scrolling (scrollspy selects the topmost group)
  - Focusing inputs within a group
- During programmatic navigation/scroll, breadcrumb updates are briefly deferred to avoid flicker.

### Public maps/refs other modules use

`core/form-generator.js` exposes these fields for features:

- `groupElements`: Map of `groupId → { element, path, title, isSection? }`.
- `fieldSchemas`: Map of `fieldPath → schema`.
- `fieldElements`: Map of `fieldPath → controlElement`.
- `fieldToGroup`: Map of `fieldPath → groupId`.
- `navigationTree`: HTMLElement assigned to the sidebar’s `.form-navigation-tree`.

These are considered part of the internal contract that `features/navigation.js` and `features/validation.js` depend on.

### Code documentation

- All core, features, and component classes are documented with JSDoc at class level and for their primary methods. Highlights:
  - `core/form-nodeview.js`: parsing `{ schema, data }`, mounting via the factory, serializing back to the document. Sidebar creation lives in the factory.
  - `core/form-generator.js`: data/model/generation lifecycle and the responsibilities of each helper.
  - `core/input-factory.js`, `core/group-builder.js`, `core/highlight-overlay.js`, `core/form-model.js`: single responsibilities and return types.
  - `features/navigation.js` and `features/validation.js`: public APIs.
  - `components/sidebar.js`: component API (`onNavigationClickHandler`, `getNavigationTree`, `destroy`).
  - `core/form-mount.js`: factory API and responsibilities.

You can generate API documentation with any JSDoc tooling if desired; the code comments are written to be compatible with standard JSDoc parsers.

### How to extend

- Add a control type
  1) Implement creation in `core/input-factory.js` (`create…Input`).
  2) Return the control element or container with a single focusable control inside.
  3) The factory attaches events via the injected callbacks from `FormGenerator`.

- Add a behavior (feature)
  1) Create a module in `features/` that takes `formGenerator` as a dependency.
  2) Read the public maps/refs listed above; do not mutate DOM structure directly.
  3) Instantiate the feature in `FormGenerator`’s constructor (similar to `Navigation` and `Validation`).

- Change grouping/sections
  - Update `core/group-builder.js`. Keep group/section ID rules intact for sidebar parity.

- Change data shaping
  - Update `core/form-model.js` (base JSON, deepMerge, setNestedValue).

### Developer checklist (before merging changes)

- **Data-first?** Does every structural change (activate/add/remove/reorder/reset) mutate JSON through the command API and then rebuild/validate?
- **Schema+data only?** Are new UI decisions based on schema/data (not DOM queries)?
- **Optional children**: For array items, are optional nested objects left out by default and only rendered when required or activated?
- **ID/path consistency**: Are IDs generated via `pathToGroupId/arrayItemId` and paths escaped consistently?
- **Validation timing**: After structural updates, is `validateAllFields()` scheduled post-rebuild?
- **Navigation parity**: Does the sidebar reflect the full nested structure based on data (no duplicate entries, no missing children)?
- **Docs**: If you changed behavior (activation, defaults, renderAllGroups semantics), did you update README/README-FLOW?

### Common pitfalls (avoid these)

- Triggering DOM clicks to create items (causes loops); mutate data then rebuild instead.
- Counting DOM nodes to derive array sizes; read from JSON (`FormUiModel.getNestedValue`).
- Auto-including optional nested objects under array items on add; keep defaults minimal.
- Updating IDs/paths by ad-hoc regex in multiple places; use the centralized helpers.

### Raw JSON mode

There is no raw JSON mode UI in the current implementation. The form view is the sole editing surface. Use the factory API to read or replace data programmatically.

### Error handling and markers

- `Validation.getValidationError()` performs basic checks: required, min/max, regex, enum, formats (email/url).
- Inline errors appear in `.form-ui-error` after the control and add `.invalid` to the control.
- Sidebar error badges: groups with any error are marked with `.has-error` and an inline SVG triangle icon positioned by `--nav-level`.

### Testing suggestions

- Snapshot the generated DOM for a representative schema (see `html-structure.html`) to guard IDs/classes and group/section layout.
- Unit test `FormUiModel` (deepMerge, setNestedValue) and `GroupBuilder` (ID formation and section vs group decisions).
- Unit test `InputFactory` required flag propagation and focus/blur highlighting hooks.

### Troubleshooting

- Sidebar indicator misaligned after window resize: ensure `Navigation.enableScrollSync()` is active; it re-computes indicator dimensions on `resize`.
- If drag-and-drop reordering does nothing, verify nav items have `data-array-path` and `data-item-index` set.
